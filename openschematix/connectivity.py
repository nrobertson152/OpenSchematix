"""Connection analysis: junction dots, unconnected wire ends and terminals.

Rules (common schematic practice):
  * Wires are connected where an end point of one wire lies on another wire
    (end, corner or anywhere along a segment).
  * Component terminals connect only to wire END points; a wire that merely
    passes over a terminal is not connected to it (same rule as KiCad).
  * Two wires that merely cross are NOT connected.
  * A junction dot is drawn where three or more branches meet.

Performance (spatial index)
---------------------------
For every wire end point and corner, the analysis counts the wires that end
at or pass through that point. Testing every wire for every point is
O(P * S) (P points, S segments), i.e. quadratic in drawing size. A
`_WireIndex` built once per call narrows the wires examined for each point:

  * The plane is divided into square cells of `_CELL` drawing units. Each
    wire is registered in every cell overlapped by the bounding box of any of
    its segments, padded by `_PAD`. A query looks at one cell only.
  * The exact per-wire tests (`same`, `point_on_segment`, default tolerance)
    are unchanged; the index only discards wires that cannot pass them, so
    results, tolerances and output order are identical to a full scan.
  * `_PAD` must cover every point `point_on_segment` accepts, not just the
    perpendicular tolerance: its general (non axis-aligned) branch accepts
    points up to tol/length beyond a segment end along the segment. That
    branch requires |dx| > tol and |dy| > tol, so length > sqrt(2)*tol and
    the overshoot is below 1/sqrt(2) units; `_PAD` = tol + 1 covers it.
  * Memory is linear in the number of segments: a segment whose padded box
    covers more than `_MAX_CELLS_PER_SEGMENT` cells (long diagonals, huge
    coordinates), a wire with non-finite coordinates or fewer than two
    points, and every wire once the total registrations would exceed
    `_ENTRY_BUDGET_PER_SEGMENT * S + _ENTRY_BUDGET_MIN`, goes to an
    "always examine" list instead of the grid. Those wires are tested for
    every point, exactly as before, so correctness never depends on the cap.

Complexity: building O(S * c) with c <= _MAX_CELLS_PER_SEGMENT cells per
segment (c is about length/_CELL + 2 for axis-aligned wires); memory
O(min(S * c, _ENTRY_BUDGET_PER_SEGMENT * S + _ENTRY_BUDGET_MIN)); each query
O(k + A) wire tests, k = wires registered in the cell, A = always-examined
wires. In the worst case (everything always-examined) it degrades to the
previous full scan plus a small constant. The index is local to one call:
nothing is cached between calls.
