"""Reading and writing ``.schematix`` project files, and opening older
documents (including legacy single-sheet drawings).

The ``.schematix`` container is a ZIP archive (see docs/FILE_FORMAT.md):

    mimetype                         application/x-openschematix-project (stored, first)
    manifest.json                    container format/version, app version, sheet list
    project.json                     metadata, settings, layers, sheet order
    sheets/<sheet uid>.json          one JSON document per sheet
    symbols/<n>.osym                 embedded custom symbol definitions
    revisions/index.json             revision history entries
    revisions/objects/<sha256>       content-addressed, zlib-compressed snapshots

All member paths are relative and machine-independent. Files are written to
a temporary file in the destination folder, flushed to disk and then
atomically renamed over the destination, so an interrupted save never
damages the previous file.
