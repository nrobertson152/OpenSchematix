"""Symbol library registry.

Three layers are searched in order:
  1. project symbols - custom symbols embedded in the open project (the
     exact versions its drawings were made with);
  2. user library    - custom symbols in the user's own libraries;
  3. built-in        - the read-only symbols shipped with the program.
Built-in ids can never be overridden by custom symbols.
